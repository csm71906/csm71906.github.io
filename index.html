	<h4>Tiger's Childhood</h4>
	<p>Eldrick Woods, known to millions of fans as Tiger Woods, was born as an only child
on December 30, 1975, in Cypress, California. His father, Earl Woods, recognized his talent
from a young age and from there devoted a lot of his time to ensure that his son's talents could
flourish. Tiger won his first tournament at the age of 8, and from that point on, there was no limit
to how good he would become. There is no doubt that golf was a major part of Tiger's life, especially 
when he spent countless hours practicing his swing and techniques, but this did not keep him from living a 
normal childhood. Tiger still joked around and ate sweets as a normal child would do, however 
none of us could quite expect what would be in store for young Tiger Wood's future.	</p> 
	<h4>Tiger's Junior and College Career</h4>
	<p>Tiger Woods was a dominant force no one had ever seen before on the junior and collegiate 
golf circuit. Woods won the <i> U.S. Junior Championship </i> an unpresidented <b>3 times in a row</b> and in 1994 
became the youngest winner in the tournament's history. He also won countless other tournaments on various
top level junior golf tours, which concluded one of the best junior golf careers ever seen.</p>
<div style="float:center"><p><IMG src="tw junior golf.jpg" alt="tiger woods"> </div><p><br> Tiger continued his dominant golf
career by enrolling at Stanford University in the fall of 1994 on a full ride golf scholarship. While in 
college at Stanford he won numerous college tournaments highlighted by an NCAA individual championshipn in 
1996. While in college, his amatuer career did not seem to skip a beat either. He continued his domination of USGA 
Championships by winning the <i> U.S. Amateur Championship </i> three years straight in 1994, 1995, and 1996. Seeing his
career truly beginning to flourish, Tiger forewent his junior and senior year of college at Stanford in order
to become a professional golfer. </p>

	<p> Tiger Woods turned professional in August of 1996 and looked to have a smooth transition from his amateur 
career to his life on the PGA Tour. Woods began his career by signing endoresement deals with Nke and Titleist 
that were two of the highest paying endoresement deals the golf world had ever seen. He recorded his first
victory on the PGA Tour at the Las Vegas Invitational, which was a mere 2 months into Wood's professional career.
Tiger went on to win one more time in the 1996 season before being named PGA Tour Rookie of the Year and earning 
a spot in the Tour Championship. Tiger Woods was quickly becoming a golf legacy that everyone loved and wanted to 
follow around at every tournament he played in. Five out of the next seven years Woods had at least 5 victories 
on the PGA Tour and was now the face of Nike Golf. Woods currently has 79 career wins, which is second all-time 
among golfers, but perhaps the single most impressive thing he accomplished in his professional golf career 
were the 14 major golf championships he won, second all-time to only Jack Nicklaus. Though he continues to chase 
Jack's mark to add to his legacy, there is no doubt Tiger Woods will go down in history as the greatest golfer of
all-time for everything he has done, on and off the course, for the game of golf. </p>
